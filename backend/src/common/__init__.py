"""This module groups common code shared amongst the different microservices implementations

Shared code include some domain objects and models, but also globally used services like 
those used to connect to a remote microservice as a client, the shotgrid and dynamo db clients,
 the auth manager and permission services, as well as some commonly used settings.
